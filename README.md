## Mission Statement 
In Canada, pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals threaten the right to live. Despite noted advancements to reduce air pollution, Canadaians are chronically exposed to a multitude of toxic chemicals through the air they breathe. Chronic exposure to various hazardous substances contributes tremendously to premature deaths and numerous respiratory diseases/disabilities. In 2015, urban air pollution including exposure to PM2.5 accounted for 7,712 deaths. Another study found strikingly high rates of acute myeloid leukaemia linked to elevated levels of air pollution in Sarnia and Hamilton, above the national average. Despite air pollution being a nation-wide problem, certain socioeconomic demographics are at greater health risks than others. 

A 2018 analysis found health inequalities exist on various socioeconomic statuses including income and employment, and that certain groups such as Indigenous peoples, immigrants and racial minorities, had worse health outcomes than the general population. More than one million low-income Canadians live within one kilometer of a major source of industrial pollution, resulting in elevated risks of hospitalization for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. A 2003 study in Ontario found a correlation between exposure impacts of particulate matter and SO2 depend on income level. A 2008 mapping of 17 neighborhoods in Toronto showed a high release of combined air pollutants and poverty rates. Similar results were published in Hamilton.
